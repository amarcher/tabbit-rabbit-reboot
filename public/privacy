  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: February 12, 2026</p>

  <p>Tabbit Rabbit ("we", "our", "the app") is a bill-splitting application. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we receive your email address and display name from Google. We store this to identify your account.</p>
  <p><strong>Profile information:</strong> You may optionally provide a display name and payment usernames (Venmo, Cash App, PayPal). These are stored so others can pay you through shared bills.</p>
  <p><strong>Bill data:</strong> Tab names, item descriptions, prices, and participant names that you create within the app.</p>
  <p><strong>Receipt images:</strong> If you use the receipt scanning feature, uploaded images are stored temporarily to extract item data and are not used for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used solely to provide the bill-splitting service: creating tabs, splitting costs, generating payment links, and sharing bills with others. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored securely on Supabase (hosted on AWS). The mobile app caches previously viewed shared bills locally on your device for offline access.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In</strong> for authentication</li>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> for data storage and authentication</li>
    <li><strong>Anthropic (Claude)</strong> for receipt image processing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Payment links (Venmo, Cash App, PayPal) open directly in those apps. We do not process any payments.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your tabs and bill data at any time within the app. To request full account deletion, contact us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date at the top of this page indicates when it was last revised.</p>
